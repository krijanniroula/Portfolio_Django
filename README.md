# My first Django website, Portfolio_Django

=================================================================================

This is my first try using Django and, I am loving it. 

Here, it simply shows all of your projects in home page--'Read More' button simply provide extra detail view to the
selected content. There is a blog type structure added which will give other visitor to comment on the topic, alongside all of CRUD
functionality.
